# Sales-Forecasting-with-Facebook-Prophet

<i>Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.</i>

In this notebook, we will test the Facebook Prophet tool on data regarding sales in differemt shops. We will use two dataframes, one containing data related to the shops, one containing sales by shop and day by day. We will do some data preprocessing and analysis, first by singular dataset, then merging the two of them. And then we will apply the Facebook tool and check its results.
